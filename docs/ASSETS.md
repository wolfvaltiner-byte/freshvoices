## customers/ logo inventory

Naming convention: lowercase-with-hyphens (e.g. `hermes-apotheke.png`, `wko.svg`).

"Real alpha" column = has genuine transparency (confirmed by pixel sampling or SVG structure). Logos without real alpha render as a visible rectangular card (their opaque canvas edge) rather than blending seamlessly into the dark background — cosmetic, not broken, under the current `grayscale(1) brightness(1.6)` filter (see Logo rendering treatment above for why an earlier filter made these unreadable).

| File | Status | Real alpha |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hermes-apotheke.png` | Fetched from hermesapotheke.at (WP) | YES |
| `hilfswerk.svg` | **Fixed** — full-canvas `#fbc707` background `<path>` deleted, viewBox unchanged (`0 0 377.94666 377.94666`); `#231f20`/`#ffffff` artwork paths untouched | YES (was NO) |
| `wko.svg` | Fetched from wko.at. Two-tone (red blocks + white letters) — doesn't need real alpha, just needed the grayscale filter fix above (see Logo rendering treatment) to stay legible | YES |
| `paulaner-apotheke.png` | Fetched from paulaner-apotheke.at (WP) | YES |
| `stern-apotheke.png` | Fetched from stern-apo.at (WP) | YES |
| `bormes-les-mimosas.svg` | Fetched from bormeslesmimosas.com | YES |
| `logo-banner.svg` | Same colour palette as bormes-les-mimosas.svg — a second Bormes les Mimosas variant, NOT Fresh Voices' own logo. Left untouched pending Wolf's decision. | YES |
| `logo_big.svg` | White-only fills, 6:1 aspect ratio — Fresh Voices' own wordmark. **Removed from the clients.html ref-strip** (file kept on disk, unreferenced from any page) | YES (white on transparent) |
| `macjingle-488x254.webp` | **Blocked** — VP8 lossy (no alpha), and JS-rendered inline SVG on the live site so can't be re-fetched automatically. Superseded on the page by `macjingle-488x254.png` (see below); Wolf should still supply a real vector logo when possible. | **NO** |
| `wincom.png` | Fetched from wincommunication.fr (15 KB, replaces old 1.2 MB file). Real alpha, but a detailed mic+waveform icon mark — reads faint at 36px in the logo wall. Not a bug, just a legibility ceiling for this asset at this size. | YES |
| `radio-klassik.png` | Fetched from radioklassik.at. Full-bleed diamond-pattern badge with no separate background — flood-fill transparency doesn't apply (see below), but it reads fine under the corrected grayscale filter, so it's used as-is. | **NO** — RGB, no alpha channel |
| `LoungeFM.png` | **Blocked** — server returns 403 for automated requests. Keep existing. | YES |
| `oecolution.jpg` | **Blocked** — SSL certificate error on oecolution.at. Superseded on the page by `oecolution.png` (see below). | **NO** — JPG format |
| `OVERDUB.png` | Superseded on the page by `OVERDUB-transparent.png` (see below). | **NO** — all pixels opaque |
| `little-lights-logo.png` | Superseded on the page by `little-lights-logo-transparent.png` (see below). | **NO** — all pixels opaque |
| `spreadfilms-logo.svg` | Kept as-is (marked SKIP — already good) | YES |
| `Logo_Schutzengel.png` | Same source URL as existing; no replacement needed | YES |

### Flood-fill transparency fixes (2026-07-25, wired into clients.html)

Automated background removal (Python/Pillow) on the raster logos that lacked real alpha, reviewed and now live in both the `.logo-wall` grid and `.ref-strip`:

| File | Source | Method | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `little-lights-logo-transparent.png` | `little-lights-logo.png` | Corner flood-fill, ±14 tolerance | Dark navy background removed, white silhouette intact. |
| `oecolution.png` | `oecolution.jpg` | Corner flood-fill, ±14 tolerance | Teal gradient background removed (corner-seeded fill tracked the gradient drift fine), text/dot-mark intact. |
| `macjingle-488x254.png` | `macjingle-488x254.webp` | Corner flood-fill, ±14 tolerance | Background removed cleanly despite the lossy WebP source; still just a stopgap for the real vector logo. |
| `OVERDUB-transparent.png` | `OVERDUB.png` | **Global color-key** (±24 tolerance on white), not corner flood-fill | The corner-only fill left the letter counters (holes in O/D/R/U/B) opaque white, since it's pure black-on-white with no intentional white artwork, a global color-key was safe here and also cleared the interior holes. Confirmed clean under both the resting (grayscale) and hover (full-color) states. |

`radio-klassik.png` has no separate background to remove (the diamond pattern is full-bleed to the edges), so flood-fill was skipped entirely — it's used as-is and looks fine once the grayscale filter fix (above) stopped forcing it to solid white.
